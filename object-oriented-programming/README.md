# Object-Oriented Programming Workshop - Overview

This repository contains laboratory projects developed for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course in the **Computer Engineering and Science** program (2024-2025). The labs focus on mastering all aspects of **Java programming**, from basic syntax to advanced application development. Topics include:

- **Java Compilation**: Understanding how Java code is compiled and executed, covering `javac` and `java` commands.
- **Project Creation**: Learning how to start a Java project from scratch, including setting up the development environment, organizing files, and managing dependencies.
- **Java Applications**: Developing fully functional Java applications, from console-based programs to more complex ones with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- **GUI Development**: Exploring the creation of interactive applications using JavaFX or Swing.
- **Object-Oriented Concepts**: Applying OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Using tools and techniques to debug Java code, and ensuring the correctness of applications through unit testing.

Through practical exercises, students will gain hands-on experience in developing robust Java applications, enhancing their understanding of object-oriented principles, and applying best practices to real-world problems.
